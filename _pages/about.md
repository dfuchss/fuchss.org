Researcher at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/), Germany.

My overall goal is the utilization of informal sketches and diagrams for automatic traceability link recovery (TLR) and consistency checking during agile software development processes.
In 2021, I presented the overall idea of my studies on ECSA Doctoral Symposium.
