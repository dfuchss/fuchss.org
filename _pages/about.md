Researcher at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/), Germany.

My overall goal is the utilization of informal artifacts for automatic traceability link recovery (TLR) and consistency checking.
In my recent research I focus on the application of large language models for TLR tasks, such as retrieval augmented generation.

If you want to contact me securely, please use my [PGP key](/pgp-key/).

My research area and interests summarized in a short listing:

- Natural Language Processing
- Traceability Link Recovery
- Consistency between formal and informal artifacts
- Retrieval Augmented Generation & Large Language Models for Software Engineering

During my research and teaching I'm involved in several development projects. A small excerpt is shown below.

- Member of the Main Development Team of [ardoco](/projects/ardoco/)
- Administrator of our [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis) infrastructure that is used for the Programming Lecture, Software Engineering I, and more lectures
- Product Owner of multiple projects of [kit-sdq](https://github.com/kit-sdq)
- Member of the Maintainer Team of [JPlag](https://github.com/JPlag)
