# jekyll-socials

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-socials.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-socials)

A plugin to help add social media info to your site. For more information, check the [documentation](https://george-gca.github.io/jekyll-socials/).

## Supported Web Fonts

This plugin supports three web font libraries for rendering social media icons:

1. **[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)** - A comprehensive icon library with support for brands and general symbols
2. **[Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)** - Specialized icons for academic platforms and publications
3. **[Scholar Icons](https://louisfacun.github.io/scholar-icons/)** - Additional icons for technical and coding platforms

### Using Icons from Other Font Sources

While this plugin comes with built-in support for the three font libraries above, you can use icons from any other font library you add to your site. Simply provide the icon class name in the `logo` field of a custom social or when overriding a built-in social's icon. The plugin will automatically detect whether the value is a file path (by checking for file extensions like .png, .jpg, .svg) or an icon class.

## Built-in Social Platforms

The plugin includes built-in support for 53 social media and academic platforms:

### Academic & Research Platforms

Additionally, the plugin supports **custom socials** with user-provided logos (images or icon classes) and URLs.

## Customizing Social Icons

### Overriding Icons for Built-in Socials

You can override the default icons for any of the built-in social platforms. This is useful if you want to use a different icon from a different font library. For example, to use a different Letterboxd icon:

```yml
letterboxd_id:
  value: your_letterboxd_username # the actual username or ID value
  logo: fa-brands fa-letterboxd # override with custom icon class
```

This allows you to customize the appearance of any built-in social while keeping all the URL handling logic intact.

### Custom Socials with Custom Logos

For socials not in the built-in list, you can create custom entries with your own logos and URLs:

```yml
custom_social:
  logo: custom-font-icon-class # Any icon class from fonts you've added
  title: My Custom Social
  url: https://example.com
```

## Building and Releasing a New Version

To build and release a new gem version:

1. **Build the gem** - This creates a `.gem` file from the current gemspec:

   ```bash
   gem build jekyll-socials.gemspec
   ```

2. **Push to RubyGems** - This publishes the gem to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/), making it available for installation:
   ```bash
   gem push jekyll-socials-X.X.X.gem
   ```
   Replace `X.X.X` with the actual version number (e.g., `jekyll-socials-0.0.6.gem`).

The version number should be updated in [lib/jekyll-socials/version.rb](lib/jekyll-socials/version.rb) before building.
