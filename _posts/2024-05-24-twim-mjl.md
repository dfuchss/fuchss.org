[MatrixJoinLink](https://github.com/dfuchss/MatrixJoinLink) is bot that allows the creation of invite links to non-public rooms in matrix.
Some months have passed since I initially introduced the bot in [TWIM](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/04/this-week-in-matrix-2023-08-04/).
The bot addresses the challenge of being unable to invite individuals via a link to a non-public room or space.

In the [latest release](https://github.com/dfuchss/MatrixJoinLink/releases), I ensure that the users that interact with the bot always have the right permissions.
**Thus, if you use the bot, you should update to this version :)**

#### How to use JoinLink

MatrixJoinLink simplifies the process of inviting users to non-public spaces. The easy way to use the bot:

1. Invite the bot into your room.
2. After the bot joined, use the command `!join help` to explore its features. Please note that the bot responds exclusively to users or servers configured by the bot owner.
3. To create a Join Link, kindly type `!join link Demonstration_Link`, and the bot generates a join link for you. Ensure that you and the bot have the permission to invite users.

Feel free to test the bot and raise any issue using GitHub :)
