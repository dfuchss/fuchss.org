[YARB](https://github.com/dfuchss/YARB) is a bot you can use to create reminders for specific times at the current day.
It has been build using [Trixnity](https://trixnity.gitlab.io/trixnity/) and my [abstraction layer](https://github.com/dfuchss/matrix-bot-base) on top of it.

#### Features

- Create reminders for a specific time at the current day.
- Configure an offset for the reminder time (-the bot could remind you 3 minutes in advance)
- Change display name per room
- Change bot command name (you don't need to use _yarb_ as command ðŸ˜‰)
- Simple rights management (same as for my other bots)

#### How to use the bot

- After the bot has joined, use `!yarb help` to get an overview about the features of the bot (remember: the bot only respond to users)
- In order to create a new reminder use `!yarb <time<message`. The time has to be in the format `HH:mm` (e.g., `!yarb 12:00 Lunch time!`).

#### Development

I'm typically online in the [#trixnity:imbitbu.de](https://matrix.to/#/#trixnity:imbitbu.de) channel. So feel free to tag me there if you have any questions. Also, feel free to test the bot and raise any issue using GitHub :)
