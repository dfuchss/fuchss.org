DeltaBot is my first bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). It formerly used [RASA](https://rasa.com/) as classifier for user input.
It was able to tell jokes, read from RSS feeds to provide news, and much more.
The bot also includes a simple dialog management. The code of the bot is available under GPL3 via [GitHub](https://github.com/dfuchss/DeltaBot).
