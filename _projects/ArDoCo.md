In [Architecture Documentation Consistency (ArDoCo)](https://ardoco.de/), we aim to provide consistency analyses between different kind of documentation, namely models and informal (textual) documentation.
For this purpose, we provide a pipeline-based approach that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from the documentation.
It uses several heuristics to link the extracted information to the models (e.g., architecture models or source code).
Using these links, ArDoCo is also able to detect inconsistencies between the documentation and the models.

ArDoCo is actively developed by researchers of the _[Modelling for Continuous Software Engineering (MCSE) group](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu)_ of _[KASTEL - Institute of Information Security and Dependability](https://kastel.kit.edu)_ at the [KIT](https://www.kit.edu).
