  summary: A researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology since 2020. In my research, I deal with the use of informal models such as sketches, diagrams and natural language in software development. One focus here is the use of Large Language Models for Traceability Link Recovery. I'm also one of the maintainers of JPlag, a state-of-the-art software plagiarism & collusion detector. Finally, I'm maintaining multiple personal OSS projects on GitHub.
