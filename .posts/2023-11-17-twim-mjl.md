[MatrixJoinLink](https://github.com/dfuchss/MatrixJoinLink) is bot that allows the creation of invite links to non-public rooms in matrix.

Several months have passed since I initially introduced the bot in [TWIM](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/04/this-week-in-matrix-2023-08-04/).
In the interim, I've seamlessly incorporated the bot into various work related contexts as well as in private contexts.
The bot addresses the challenge of being unable to invite individuals via a link to a non-public room or space.
Since my last announcement, I further improved UX. The bot is now able to deal with various room identifiers (i.e., matrix.to links, internal room ids, and public room aliases).

### How to use JoinLink

MatrixJoinLink simplifies the process of inviting users to non-public spaces.
Here's a guide on how to make the most of it:

1. Invite the bot into your room.
2. Once the bot joins, use the command `!join help` to explore its features. Please note that the bot responds exclusively to users or servers configured by the bot owner.
3. To create a Join Link, kindly type `!join link Demonstration_Link`, and the bot will promptly generate a join link for you. Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions to invite users.

Feel free to test the bot and raise any issue using GitHub or using the development room that is mentioned in the project's [README](https://github.com/dfuchss/MatrixJoinLink). Also consult the README for technical details.
